Back in record time, we're here to provide closure for our 9/11 story. Last time we touched on this national tragedy and its discontents, we dealt with stuff that, while fundamentally incorrect, was at least based on reasonable suspicions. This time, we're only dealing with 9/11 truthers who are either unbelievably racist, completely unhinged, or both. And yes, we are finally pleased to unveil THE CRAZIEST BOOK WE'VE EVER READ.
