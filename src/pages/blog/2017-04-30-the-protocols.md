### The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: Interview with Professor John Efron

Hello and welcome to the second episode of The Paranoid Strain, your skeptical guide to conspiracy theories.

“Wait,” you may be thinking. “Did you guys release two episodes at once?” Yep. We sure did. Going forward, we’ll be putting out single episodes, one every other month. But since the first episode is basically an introduction to the topic, we decided to put out a more representative single-topic show as well. Enjoy.

This episode, we’re covering the history and impact of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a notorious anti-semitic lie that was conclusively debunked nearly a century ago, and yet is still widely believed and hugely influential today. We’ll lead you through the history of this screed, some of the many monsters it influenced, and how it has ruined people’s lives around the world. We’ve got an interview with an expert on Jewish history, a pop song by an orthodox rabbi, and we make fun of Henry Ford. What’s not to love?

Subscribe to the show at iTunes, on Pocketcasts, on Stitcher, or any of your other favorite platforms. And if you’re an iTunes user, please do rate and review us. It’s super-helpful, and we’ll love you forever.
