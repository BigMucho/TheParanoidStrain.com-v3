Just in time for the 4th of July, we're back to our regularly scheduled programming. This time, we're bringing you the story of 9/11, and the Truthers who are only too happy to remind you that jet fuel can't…well, you know.

As you can discern from the title, our next full episode is going to handle the second part of this story–this one's all about reasonable people's doubts about 9/11. The next one is all about the pure-D batshit craziness. We hope you'll enjoy both.

In between, next month, expect another edition of our Stupid Land collaboration, only this time on the subject of our nation's largest recent tragedy. I'm sure they'll be very sensitive. Oh, Jeez.
