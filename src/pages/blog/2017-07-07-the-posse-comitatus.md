Welcome to the inevitable third episode of The Paranoid Strain.
{: .present-before-paste}

“Well. Took you long enough.” That’s what I hear you thinking. Yes, it’s been a couple of months since our last episode. And for the moment, that’s about the pace you should expect. Each of these shows represents a huge amount of research and production time, and we have a day job, and a kid, and other distractions. Eventually, we hope to come to you on a more frequent basis, but until then, let’s just enjoy our time together.

This episode has a special place in our hearts. It’s the first of three parts on the conspiracy-minded, frequently violent, deeply paranoid right-wing extremist movement, which has been known as the “militia”, “freeman on the land”, and currently the “sovereign citizen” ideology, but which started out back in the 1950s with one angry, anti-semitic, delusional man named Bill, who wanted to form a Posse.
