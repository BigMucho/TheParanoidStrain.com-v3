I can already hear you: "It's been two months. Where's the new episode of our favorite anti-conspiracy theory podcast?"

What? We're not your *favorite*? You've been seeing&nbsp;**other**&nbsp;anti-conspiracy theory podcasts? How&nbsp;**could**&nbsp;you? Think of the children.

Anyhoo, what we bring to you today is not a new standard-issue episode. In fact, you can think of this as episode 7.5. Mostly because that's what we've called it. And to bring it to you, we've partnered with the Chads over at the brand new–as in, so new that it doesn't technically have a website or any current episodes yet–podcast **[Stupid Land](https://stupid.land/)**.

This is the first of what will be an ongoing series. Every other month, we will post a new audio…what are we calling these things? Let's go with "pastiche" based on the previous month's episode topic. This one, for example, deals with False Flags and Alex Jones. Sort of. Anyway, expect short-form, absurdist flights of fancy with impeccable audio production at the beginning of every month that doesn't feature a standard episode. It's our way of doubling your listening pleasure without ever having to leave the cozy confines of our podcast feed.

We hope you like it. We like it a lot. And yes, it's weird. We wouldn't have it any other way.

Ladies and gentlemen: Episode 7.5 – Stupidland takes on False Flags and Alex Jones
