Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a plane spraying evil, toxic, murderous chemtrails! Nope. It's the Paranoid Strain.

Howdy! Having rested up after our three-part exploration of the right-wing Sovereign Citizen and Posse Comitatus movements,  we're ready to move onto attacking a conspiracy that is far more popular with the other side of the aisle. If you've ever wondered why some folks seem to believe those vapor trails that planes emit are a threat to our very way of life, we've got the answers. And no, none of them are "they're RIGHT!"

Oh, and the "HAARP" acronym in the title refers to the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, an ionospheric research station in Alaska. Why are we talking about that? If you guessed that some misguided conspiracists have decided it is also a threat to our very way of life, give yourself a pat on the back. You've earned it, slugger.

As always, if you’ve got comments, suggestions, or really any feedback, please contact us by email at theparanoidstrain at gmail dot com, on Twitter @theparanoidstrain, or at our home on the web, theparanoidstrain.com.
