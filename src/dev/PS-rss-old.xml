        <itunes:summary>Ever wonder why so many people around you believe so many weird conspiracy theories? So do we. This show explains the history of these beliefs, why people believe them even after they've been debunked, and how those beliefs can impact the real world. We interview experts, read a lot of books, and then tell you all about it. With jokes.</itunes:summary>

            <description>Hey there, Strainiacs. Today, we bring you another of our Quick Hit episodes. Yes, that means the return of the Quick Hit guy. PARANOID STRAIN! QUICK HIT!!!!! Yeah. We missed him, too. It’s also a weird sort of hybrid. We were planning to do a show based on our interview and tour at Denver International Airport in 2017, where we were able to carefully document the true stories behind the unmitigated spew of nonsense you’ll get from conspiracists about the place’s sinister origins and purpose. But at the same time, we realized we had more to say about Alex Jones that we didn’t fully cover in our False Flags episode last year. So rather than choose, we just kinda…glued them together. We hope you enjoy, then, a quick catch-up on the long, ongoing fall of Alex Jones and Infowars, as well as a fun overview of the DEN nonsense. As... (read more at TheParanoidStrain.com)</description>

            <description>Ok. Nobody panic. It’s happening again.

                But we’ve been through this before, haven’t we? We understand that sometimes terrible things happen. Wars. Plagues. Disasters. Stupid Land.

                Yes, they’re back. And it appears they’re multiplying–this episode relates a report from a hitherto unsuspected third Chad. Whether this 50% increase in Chadness is through ideological reprogramming, some sort of slimy parthenogenesis, or simply the cruel whim of a callous deity, we now must experience their collective take on our previous episode. Flat Earth. Which, to be fair, is nearly as stupid as the Land they call home.

                Enjoy or endure, and we’ll see you next month with a regular episode.

                <description>Welcome back to your home away from home, the Paranoid Strain. This time, we squash flat earth beliefs…well, flat, I suppose. Stupid English language.  We both know that flat earthers are all over the place these days. But why? And how? And where did all of these ideas come from? As you might expect, since we’re raising all of these rhetorical questions, we have rhetorical answers. We’ve been through some dark, strange stuff over the past few episodes, what with 9/11 and the disturbing rantings of Qanon fans. This time, we’re tackling a belief that truly deserves the sobriquet “wacky”.  We had a lot of fun with this one. Hope you will, too. Find us on the social medias, join our Facebook and Youtube pages, and spread the word. Thank you kindly.

                <description>Wait–we’re doing this again? Many have approached me, deep concern on their eager faces. “Why, Fearful?” they plead. “Why do you let them do such awful, unspeakable things to your beautiful podcast feed?” I always know what they’re talking about. They’re referring to the Chads, and their eldritch power over me. I wish I could give them a better understanding–I lack that understanding myself. Perhaps I should never have angered the Swamp Witch. Maybe it was a bad idea to plunder that unmarked grave in the abandoned cemetery at the end of the dirt road. Arguably, I shouldn’t have dropped that bloody hitchhiker off, as he requested, next to the girls’ sleepaway camp. I definitely shouldn’t have offered him a free sharpening for his knife.

                <description>Back in record time, we’re here to provide closure for our 9/11 story. Last time we touched on this national tragedy and its discontents, we dealt with stuff that, while fundamentally incorrect, was at least based on reasonable suspicions. This time, we’re only dealing with 9/11 truthers who are either unbelievably racist, completely unhinged, or both. And yes, we are finally pleased to unveil THE CRAZIEST BOOK WE’VE EVER READ. Enjoy, find us on the social medias, join our Facebook page, and spread the word. Thank you kindly.

                <description>I know what you’re thinking. This was supposed to be 9/11 Part 2. And don’t worry–it’s still coming. But this super-stupid Qanon thing was just begging for a good ol’ ass-whuppin’, and we decided to oblige. For those of you who’ve somehow missed it, Qanon is a seriously deranged conspiracy theory in which some of Donald Trump’s most fervent supporters assert without evidence that he is cooperating with the Mueller investigation, whose real purpose is to take down an international, child sex trafficking ring, among other things. Over the past couple of months, as the chuckleheads who believe this have become more visible at Trump rallies, drawing confused looks from the media–and the non-insane generally, they have moved up our list of must-address topics until we decided to create a whole episode around them in about half the time it normally takes us.

                <description>A brand-new, steaming heap of whatever it is that the Chads do is now here for your delectation. 

                    Following through on our lifelong, three-month commitment to delivering monthly content, we present the second of our collaborations with the weirdos at Stupid Land. This time, they’ve done…

                    something…

                    terrible with the previous episode, Part 1 of our 9/11 discussion. I’d try to explain it better, but…just listen. You’ll understand.

                    Anyway, as with the previous PS/SL collaboration, the audio production is impeccable, while the content is deeply bizarre. Keep it up, you oddball bastards.

                    See you next month. Oh, and I don’t want to forget–the Chads got they-selves a website. Now, you can visit, listen, and subscribe at the aptly named stupid.land. Won’t you?

This time, we’re bringing you the story of 9/11, and the Truthers who are only too happy to remind you that jet fuel can’t…well, you know. As you can discern from the title, our next full episode is going to handle the second part of this story–this one’s all about reasonable people’s doubts about 9/11. The next one is all about the pure-D batshit craziness. We hope you’ll enjoy both. In between, next month, expect another edition of our Stupid Land collaboration, only this time on the subject of our nation’s largest recent tragedy. I’m sure they’ll be very sensitive. Oh, Jeez.

                <description>I can already hear you: “It’s been two months. Where’s the new episode of our favorite anti-conspiracy theory podcast?” What? We’re not your favorite? You’ve been seeing other anti-conspiracy theory podcasts? How could you? Think of the children. Anyhoo, what we bring to you today is not a new standard-issue episode. In fact, you can think of this as episode 7.5. Mostly because that’s what we’ve called it. And to bring it to you, we’ve partnered with the Chads over at the brand new–as in, so new that it doesn’t technically have a website or any current episodes yet–podcast Stupid Land. This is the first of what will be an ongoing series. Every other month, we will post a new audio…what are we calling these things? Let’s go with “pastiche” based on the previous month’s episode topic. This one, for example, deals with False Flags and Alex Jones. Sort of. Anyway, expect short-form, absurdist...

And to bring it to you, we’ve partnered with the Chads over at the brand new–as in, so new that it doesn’t technically have a website or any current episodes yet–podcast <strong><a href="https://stupid.land/">Stupid Land</a></strong>.</p>

                <p>This is the first of what will be an ongoing series. Every other month, we will post a new audio…what are we calling these things? Let’s go with “pastiche” based on the previous month’s episode topic. This one, for example, deals with False Flags and Alex Jones. Sort of. Anyway, expect short-form, absurdist flights of fancy with impeccable audio production at the beginning of every month that doesn’t feature a standard episode. It’s our way of doubling your listening pleasure without ever having to leave the cozy confines of our podcast feed.</p>

                <p>We hope you like it. We like it a lot. And yes, it’s weird. We wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

                <p>Ladies and gentlemen: Episode 7.5 – Stupidland takes on False Flags and Alex Jones</p>

                <description>Call it Easter, call it April Fool’s…either way, we’ve got one helluva present for you. It’s the seventh episode of the Paranoid Strain. This time, we’re dealing with the concept of False Flags. And with the world’s most (in)famous purveyor of said concept, Alex Jones. Among the many surprising things you may learn in this episode is that, in spite of the fact that Mr. Jones is one million percent full of horseshit, false flags are actually a real thing. Just not the ones he talks about. Jones isn’t our only target, though. Many folks out there make hay out of the idea that the ever-nebulous “they” are always out there, plotting violent events that will pave the way for the public to give up their  freedoms, so “they” can feast on our precious bodily fluids. Or something. Anyway, enjoy. As always, if you’ve got comments, suggestions, or really any... (read more at TheParanoidStrain.com)</description>

This is our fifth episode, and the third of our series on the history of right wing, racist movements, and their evolution into the Sovereign Citizens. But most importantly, this is the episode where we explain why Wesley Snipes went to jail. That may seem like a weird point to harp on, but that’s actually the conundrum that we sought to explain when we originally conceived of this podcast, lo these many years ago. Honest to god, we love this episode. It’s got a bunch of great Youtube videos where Sovereigns act crazy, including the all-time grand champeen of Sovereign insanity. It’s got an interview with the guy who traced the spread of Sovereign ideas from white racists to black federal court defendants.

                <description>Hey there, loyal listener. First, we’d like to apologize. This show is coming to you several weeks after we had originally intended. We plan to make it up with you in two different ways. First, we’ve set up a public Google Calendar. We invite you to use it to stay up to date on our unfortunately still sporadic publication schedule. Second, the reason that we are late is that we spent a large chunk of our summer traveling across the United States visiting every conspiracy-related location we could find. We can’t wait to share all of the interviews and other audio we recorded, and we’ll start doing so very soon. Anyhoo, since we’re all back together now, I’m so very pleased to introduce our fourth episode, and the second in our three-part series on the history of U.S. right-wing extremism over the past seventy years or so.

In doing so, we’ll see how this way of thinking has evolved into a uniquely 21st century phenomenon. And we hope you enjoy it.</p>

Yes, it’s been a couple of months since our last episode. And for the moment, that’s about the pace you should expect. Each of these shows represents a huge amount of research and production time, and we have a day job, and a kid, and other distractions. Eventually, we hope to come to you on a more frequent basis, but until then, let’s just enjoy our time together. This episode has a special place in our hearts. It’s the first of three parts on the conspiracy-minded, frequently violent, deeply paranoid right-wing extremist movement, which has been known as the “militia”, “freeman on the land”, and currently the “sovereign citizen” ideology, but which started out back in the 1950s with one angry, anti-semitic, delusional man named Bill, who wanted to...
